# RemoteControlAllTerrainVehicle
ECE477_2015Spring_senior_design

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
Remote controlled all-terrain vehicle is a project that will allow a vehicle to cross a right angle obstacle. Two mechanical arms will be implemented to pull up and down the vehicle. Stepper motors will be used in the mechanical arms to provide precisely controlled rotations. An IR distance sensor will be used to measure the height of the step. The control signal will be communicated between the main PCB and an Android device. The signal will be sent by Bluetooth in serial. Information regarding the height of the step will be sent back to the Android device.

PROJECT SPECIFIC SUCCESS CRITERIA:
PSSC #1: An ability to send serial command stream via Android app by Bluetooth module;
PSSC #2: An ability to receive command stream;
PSSC #3: An ability to generate optimized output that provide smooth control over speed, direction and climbing movement;
PSSC #4: An ability to integrate sensor data with control input and send back to the device;
PSSC #5: An ability to send serial command stream via Android app by Bluetooth module.
